            <p>Crack machines come in many shapes and sizes. Despite their many forms, they all train the body to become
                comfortable with being uncomfortable in a jam. While board climbing helps the boulderer perform on steep
                terrain, crack machines go even further to prepare crack climbers for their ultimate project.</p>
